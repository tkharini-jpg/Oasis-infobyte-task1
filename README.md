🍷 Wine Quality Analysis
Data Analytics Internship Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Wine Quality dataset to understand how various physicochemical properties influence the quality of wine.
The analysis uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to identify patterns, relationships, and key factors affecting wine quality.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about red/white wine samples with the following attributes:

Fixed acidity

Volatile acidity

Citric acid

Residual sugar

Chlorides

Free sulfur dioxide

Total sulfur dioxide

Density

pH

Sulphates

Alcohol

Quality (target variable)

The quality score ranges from low to high, representing the overall wine quality based on sensory evaluation.

🎯 Objective

To explore and understand the structure of the dataset

To analyze relationships between chemical properties and wine quality

To visualize trends and correlations using plots

To derive meaningful insights from the data

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

🔍 Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Checked data shape, data types, and basic statistics

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Verified missing values

Ensured data consistency and quality

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis using histograms

Comparison of features across different quality levels

Identification of outliers

Correlation analysis using heatmaps

4️⃣ Data Visualization

Histograms to understand feature distributions

Box plots to analyze variation across wine quality

Correlation heatmap to identify strongly related features

📈 Key Insights

Alcohol content shows a positive correlation with wine quality

Volatile acidity tends to negatively impact quality

Certain chemical properties play a significant role in determining wine quality

Most wines fall into medium quality categories

📚 Learning Outcomes

Improved understanding of exploratory data analysis

Hands-on experience with data visualization

Ability to interpret statistical relationships

Strengthened data preprocessing skills

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics techniques can be used to extract insights from real-world datasets.
Wine Quality Analysis helped build a strong foundation in data exploration and visualization, which is essential for advanced analytics and machine learning tasks.
